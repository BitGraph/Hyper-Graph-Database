# Hyper-Graph-Database
Fundamental Principle of Higher Dimensional Graph Databases: Graph data is Isomorphic, and can store any other data structure within it algorithmically! For example: Key Value, Big Table / Column Oriented, &amp; SQL / Relational Databases can all be in an "Query &amp; Schema Translation layer" who's underlying storage is Graphs!
